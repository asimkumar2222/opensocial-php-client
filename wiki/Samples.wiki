#summary Where to find client library samples

= Samples =
To run the samples, simply unzip the client library distribution to a web accessible directory on a server that supports PHP.  

If you unzip the library to `http://www.example.com/` then you can find samples under `http://www.example.com/opensocial-php-client/samples`.  

The following samples are available:

  * Fetch a single user and display their details: /showperson/showperson.php ([http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/samples/showperson/showperson.php view source])
  * Fetch a list of the user's friends: /listfriends/listfriends.php ([http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/trunk/samples/listfriends/listfriends.php view source])

Additionally, check out the unit tests in the [http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/source/browse/#svn/trunk/tests /tests] directory for more examples of how to use the library.
