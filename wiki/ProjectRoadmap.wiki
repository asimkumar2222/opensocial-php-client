#summary Roadmap for releases of the client library
#sidebar TableOfContents

Releases of this client library follow a `<major>.<minor>.<revision>` numbering scheme. 

  * Changes to the `<revision>` number indicate a small change, usually to fix a bug.  
  * `<minor>` version changes may add new functionality but should be backwards-compatible with the previous minor version.  
  * `<major>` numbering changes indicate a version of the library that is significantly different from the previous release, and will not be guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with any previous releases.

To get a feature listed in this roadmap, please [http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/issues/list file a bug] on our issue tracker and we will prioritize it appropriately.

Our current roadmap for releases is:
